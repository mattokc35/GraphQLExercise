# GraphQL Exercise

I built this practice API with GraphQL, Node.js, Apollo Server, and Jest.

The GraphQL Schemas are found in `src/schema.js`, the Resolvers are found in `src/resolvers.js`, the test data is found in `data/menuData.js`, and the tests are found in `tests/menu.test.js`.
## Demo Locally

To demo this code locally, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/mattokc35/GraphQLExercise.git
```

Then, run npm install:

```
cd GraphQLExercise && npm install
```

Finally, use npm to run the local development server:

```
npm start
```

## Run Tests

To run the unit tests with Jest, run the command:

```
cd GraphQLExercise && npm test
```
